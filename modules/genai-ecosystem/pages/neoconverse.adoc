Neoconverse is an application to demonstrate natural language database search with GenAI.
It makes existing graph databases available to non-technical users, allowing them to issue natural language questions.
Using the graph database schema, question-statement examples, and fine-tuning, the natural language question is translated by an LLM to a graph query (Cypher). 
Which is then validated and executed against the database.

The query results are sent with the user question to the LLM to generate a natural language answer.
Alterantively the LLM can e configured to generate the data an configuration to render the results of the query as a chart for visual representation.

Neoconverse also contains infrastructure to construct knowledge graphs from unstructured data.

TODO
The front-end is a React/Streamlit Application?? and the Backend 
The frontend is a React Application and the backend a Python FastAPI.
It uses the https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/graph/constructing[llm-graph-transformer module^] that we contributed to LangChain.


== Functionality Includes

* import source documents into the 
* chunk text documents
* generate text enbeddings and vector index them
// * extract entities?
* connect similar chunks via scored similarity relationships

== How it works

1. Uploaded Sources are stored as `Document` nodes in the graph
2. Each document (type) is loaded with the LangChain Loaders
3. The content is split into Chunks 
4. Chunks are stored in the graph and connected to the Document and to each other for advanced RAG patterns
5. Highly similar Chunks are connected with a `SIMILAR` relationship to form a kNN Graph
6. Embeddings are computed and stored in the Chunks and Vector index
7. Using the llm-graph-transformer or diffbot-graph-transformer entities and relationships are extracted from the text
8. Entities are stored in the graph and connected to the originating Chunks

== Installation

The Demo is available online, https://neoconverse.neo4jlabs.com

You can also run it locally, by cloning the https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neoconverse[repository] and following the instructions in the README.md file.

It is using Docker for packaging frontend and backend, and you can run `docker-compose up` to start the whole application.
