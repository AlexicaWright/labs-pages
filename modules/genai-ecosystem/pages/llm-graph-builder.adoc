The Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph Builder is an https://llm-graph-builder.neo4jlabs.com/[online application^] for turning unstructured text into a knowledge graph, it provides a magical text to graph experience.

It uses ML models (LLM - OpenAI, Gemini, Llama3, Diffbot) to transform PDFs, web pages, and YouTube videos into a graph of entities and their relationships, which it stores in your Neo4j database.

The front-end is a React Application and the back-end a Python FastAPI application.
It uses the https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/graph/constructing[llm-graph-transformer module^] that Neo4j contributed to LangChain.

Here is a quick demo:

== Functionality Includes

1. Open the https://llm-graph-builder.neo4jlabs.com/[LLM-Knowledge Graph Builder^]
2. Connect to a https://console.neo4j.io[Neo4j (Aura)^] instance
3. Provide your PDF files, Youtube URLs, Wikipedia Keywords or S3/GCS buckets
4. Construct Graph with LLM / Diffbot
5. Visualize Knowledge Graph in App
6. Chat with your data with GraphRAG
7. Open Neo4j Bloom for further visual exploration
8. Use the constructed knowledge graph in your applications

[NOTE]
====
* Login, or create an account at https://console.neo4j.io
* Under Instances, create a new AuraDB Free Database
* Downloads the credentials file
* Wait until the instance is running
* Drop the credentials file on the connect dialog for the LLM Graph Builder

== How it works

1. Uploaded Sources are stored as `Document` nodes in the graph
2. Each document (type) is loaded with the LangChain Loaders
3. The content is split into Chunks 
4. Chunks are stored in the graph and connected to the Document and to each other for advanced RAG patterns
5. Highly similar Chunks are connected with a `SIMILAR` relationship to form a kNN Graph
6. Embeddings are computed and stored in the Chunks and Vector index
7. Using the llm-graph-transformer or diffbot-graph-transformer entities and relationships are extracted from the text
8. Entities are stored in the graph and connected to the originating Chunks

== Installation

The https://llm-graph-builder.neo4jlabs.com[LLM Knowledge Graph Builder Application^] is available online.

You can also run it locally, by cloning the https://github.com/neo4j-labs/llm-graph-builder[GitHub repository] and following the instructions in the README.md file.

It is using Docker for packaging front-end and back-end, and you can run `docker-compose up` to start the whole application.
