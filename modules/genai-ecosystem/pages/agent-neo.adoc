Agent Neo is a example architecture to demonstrate how to build and deploy a GenAI Document search application.
To enable advanced RAG patterns it utilizes a graph database to represent the underly document structures with entities for documents, chunks and entities and the relationships between them.

It uses developer documentation as example input data but can be equally applied to other types of unstructured documents like research documentation, patents, legal documents, contracts or transcripts and proceedings.

TODO
The front-end is a React/Streamlit Application?? and the Backend 
The frontend is a React Application and the backend a Python FastAPI.
It uses the https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/graph/constructing[llm-graph-transformer module^] that we contributed to LangChain.


== Functionality Includes

* import source documents into the graph database
* chunk text documents
* generate text enbeddings and vector index them
// * extract entities?
* connect similar chunks via scored similarity relationships
* employ GraphRAG to retrieve relevant chunks, their documents and related content for answering questions
* store conversations (questions and answers) in the graph and connect them back to the originating context

== How it works

1. Uploaded Sources are stored as `Document` nodes in the graph
2. Each document (type) is loaded with the LangChain Loaders
3. The content is split into Chunks 
4. Chunks are stored in the graph and connected to the Document and to each other for advanced RAG patterns
5. Highly similar Chunks are connected with a `SIMILAR` relationship to form a kNN Graph
6. Embeddings are computed and stored in the Chunks and Vector index
7. Using the llm-graph-transformer or diffbot-graph-transformer entities and relationships are extracted from the text
8. Entities are stored in the graph and connected to the originating Chunks

== Installation

The Demo is available online, https://agent-neo.neo4jlabs.com

You can also run it locally, by cloning the https://github.cosm/neo4j-labs/agent-neo[repository] and following the instructions in the README.md file.

It is using Docker for packaging frontend and backend, and you can run `docker-compose up` to start the whole application.
